"""
Focus Helper - Enforced Screen Breaks for Sway/Wayland

Locks your screen after sustained activity, forcing you to take regular breaks.
Unlike passive reminders, this actually locks the screen and keeps it locked
for LOCK_DURATION_SECONDS (re-locking if you unlock early).

Requirements:
    - swaylock (screen locker)
    - swayidle (idle detection)
    - notify-send (notifications, usually from libnotify)
    - fuser (camera-usage detection, from psmisc) — optional; meeting
      detection degrades gracefully (always locks) if it's missing
    - pw-dump (screen-share detection, from pipewire) — optional; same
      graceful degradation
    - pgrep (wl-mirror / presentation detection, from procps) — optional

Installation:
    Managed by chezmoi. This script, run_focus_daemon.sh and the lock images
    live under ~/.local/share/focus-helper/. The systemd user unit is at
    dot_config/systemd/user/focus-helper.service and is started from the sway
    config (exec systemctl --user start focus-helper.service) so it comes up
    after Wayland is ready. `chezmoi apply` runs daemon-reload automatically.

Configuration:
    Edit the constants below (USAGE_MINUTES_THRESHOLD, LOCK_DURATION_SECONDS, etc.)
